# Pac-man-in-C-language

The project is the good old-fashoned game pac-man which i have developed in C language as a part of my college project. I was unable to complete the project due to shortage of time. This is an incomplete project. In order to run this project you need code::blocks IDE and graphcs.h header file for C language.

In order to run the project only open .cbp file in code::blocks as a Open-proejct.

      1. The pac-man can pass through on side and can come-out from the other side.
